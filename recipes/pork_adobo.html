        <p>I am a proud Filipino who was raised on adobo.
        Pork adobo has to be my definitive favorite - especially if it is with pork belly.
        One of the best things about Filipino adobo is that everyone has their own recipe!
        Whether it's different ratios of ingredients or different ingredients used altogether,
        your experience of cooking adobo will be a delicious one.
        My take on adobo builds upon a traditional recipe and elevates it to a magnificent dish.</p>
